##Repetition Structure 

I used for loops to iterate through all of the slots allocated to that specific type of feature. I used it specifically for loops as they iterate through one slot at a time and have everything required to iterate through all the slots in an array.

Problems I had with this system include having to optimize the amount of calculations done over multiple large for loops. To solve this I made the for loops only iterate if the item, projectile and more was even being used. I also did not do calculations if tiles were not on screen to limit the amount of images it has to make.
