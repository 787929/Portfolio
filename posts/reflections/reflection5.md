## Selection Structure 

I used a selection structure to correlate IDs to properties so spawning a tile would automatically store the properties of that tile in the arrays.

One problem I had with this is it increased the amount of calculations majorly so I made them all else if statements so it doesn't have to check the rest of the IDs if it already found one.
