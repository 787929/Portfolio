# First Reflection
What I learned this project:

- Topic(s):
- What I struggled with:
  - Finding properties of items and tiles.
  - Managing images
- What I’m proud of:
  - Creating an ID system
  - Making a completly mineable and placeable world
  - Creating an inventory and crafting system
  - Using items
  - Making the game easily expandable
- Next steps:
  - Using an array to find the property of an ID instead of storing the property within the item / tile
  - Play around with using a PImage array to lessen the amount of if statement
